// ANW-1821 Use of the deprecated Glyphicons, combined with hardcoding
// an import from cdn of an older version (3.0.0) than icons used in markup (v3.3.0),
// has lead to this inefficient and temporary solution of importing
// Fontawesome via a cdn to pass the buck to future larger refactoring to remove
// Glyphicons from the stack completely.

// TODO Remove Glyphicons and handle Fontawesome import in a more efficient way
